# pytorch_to_coreml
Here comes one of the tricky parts. PyTorch doesnâ€™t natively support exports to CoreML (yet). Fortunately, you might have heard about an endeavour aiming at make Machine Learning models interoperable, the Open Neural Network Exchange.
ONNX provides tools for importing and exporting models from almost any framework to the .onnx format (mandatory xkcd).
